They came  together in  a series  of three\\npublic lectures as an attempted cohesive account of an event and\\nits  portents  within  the  context  of a  continent,  and  of external\\nhistories, thanks to a residency stint in Harvard University with\\nwhich,  as it happens, I have a very understanding relationship. To\\nHarvard  President  Neil  Rudenstein,  my former student,  friend,\\nand co11eague Henry Louis (Skip) Gates Jr.,  and the staf of the\\nDuBois Institute of Harvard-JoAnne Kenda11 and company-my\\nsincere appreciation for that breathing space sorely needed after\\n\\nmy \"Rambo\" departure from the Nigerian nation space.\\n\\n\\n:knowledgrnents\\n\\nI  must  not  miss  this  opportunity to express  also  especially\\nfervent  appreciation  to  that  ill-understood  institution  called\\nUNEsco for its spontaneous moral and practical support of the\\nbeleaguered citizen of a member state that chose to act contrary\\nto         its international undertakings and membership code of con\\xad\\nduct. I little realized when, as chairman of the UNEsco-affiliated\\nInternational Theatre Institute, I had to preside over meetings\\ninvolving problems of colleagues from some totalitarian states,\\nthat     a few years thence I would also become the subject of such\\nconcerns. To Director-General Federico Mayor, Henri  Lopez,\\nhis long-suffering secretary, Madame Josette Blot, and other staff\\nof uNESCO, I wish to confess how unexpected and overwhelmed I\\nhave been by their solidarity and solicitude,  and  strategies  for\\npractical upliftment. Whichever ironic paths we find ourselves,\\nindividually,  obliged  to take to  restore  that benighted  nation\\nNigeria    to  a  humanistic  course,  and  make  her  once  again  a\\nworthy partner in the ideals for which UNESCO was founded I am\\nunlikely  to  forget  the  reality of an  extended  family  of global\\nculture that one tends to take for granted.\\n\\nThere  are  many  others,  of course,  more  than  deserving  of\\nmention, whose identities must remain, for now, undisclosed.\\n\\nThe irony of the date on which the above is written has just\\nregistered: It is Independence Day in another people\\'s land, the\\nUnited States of America.\\n\\n\\nLondon\\nJuly 4•  1995\\n\\nw.s.\\n\\n\\nContents\\n\\nIntroduction,    3\\n\\nA Flawed Origin-But No Worse than Others,    17\\n\\nThe Spoils of Power:  The Buhari-Shagari Casebook,    61\\nThe National Question: Internal Imperatives,    109\\nEpilogue:  Death of an Activist,    145\\n\\nAppendix 1:  Swear in Abiola by Ibrahim Dasuki, Sultan\\nof Sokoto,    \\'55\\n\\nAppendix II: Abacha\\'s Ultimate Insult: An Eternal\\nTransition Program,     159\\n\\nIndex    163\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nt would  be difficult  today to  think  of a more  appropriate\\nintroduction to the contents of this volume than the follow\\xad\\ning article, which was first published in the Nigerian media as far\\n\\nback as June 1994.\\n\\nThe Last Despot and the End of Nigerian History?\\n\\nThere  was  once  a  thriving  habitation  of some  half a  million\\npeople in southeastern Nigeria, the land ofthe Ogoni.

        "# Insights from Verb Tense Distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dominant Tense\n",
        "The tense with the highest frequency can tell you about the primary timeframe the text is set in. For instance, a predominance of past tense verbs might suggest a narrative or historical account.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Narrative Style\n",
        "A mix of present and past tenses can indicate a more dynamic narrative, possibly shifting between events and commentary or between flashbacks and current events.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Presence of Participles\n",
        "A significant number of present participles (gerunds or continuous tense) might suggest ongoing actions or descriptions, while past participles could be indicative of passive voice constructions or perfect tenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Base Form Verbs\n",
        "A high frequency of base form verbs could suggest imperative sentences (commands, instructions) or general statements of fact or opinion.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comparison with Genre or Author Style\n",
        "If you have verb tense distributions for other texts or corpora, you can compare them to see if the observed text has any peculiarities. Some authors, for instance, might favor certain tenses due to their writing style or the nature of their narratives.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Linguistic Evolution\n",
        "If the text is part of a series or if you analyze multiple works from different time periods, you might observe shifts in tense usage, reflecting either evolving language or changing narrative techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Contextual Interpretation\n",
        "The insights should always be contextualized. For example, a historical account or memoir would understandably have a high frequency of past tense verbs, while a self-help book might have more present and base form verbs due to its instructive nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Insights from Verb Tense Distribution in a Corpus\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📜 Narrative Nature\n",
        "The dominant use of the past tense suggests that the majority of the content in the corpus pertains to events, situations, or states that have already occurred. This could mean the text is largely retrospective or historical in nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🕰 Current Relevance\n",
        "The significant presence of the present tense indicates that the corpus also discusses current events, states, or general truths. This mix of past and present tenses can be characteristic of narratives that juxtapose historical events with their current implications or commentaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔮 Anticipation or Projection\n",
        "The use of the future tense, though less than past and present, is still notable. This suggests that there's a substantial amount of content discussing anticipated events, predictions, or future intentions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📊 Statistical Observations\n",
        "The average verb tense count being 25,000, slightly above the median of 24,500, indicates a fairly even distribution across the tenses. However, the slightly higher average compared to the median suggests there's a minor skew towards one of the tenses, which in this case is the past tense.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🖋 Linguistic Choices\n",
        "A preference for the past tense might also reflect certain linguistic or stylistic choices. For instance, in many narrative styles, events are often recounted in the past tense, even if they have current relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🌐 Contextual Interpretation\n",
        "The insights should be contextualized with the nature of the corpus. If the corpus consists of autobiographical works, the dominance of past tense would be expected. If it's a series of speculative essays or predictive analyses, the presence of future tense would be significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔍 Comparative Analysis\n",
        "If you have access to verb tense distributions from other corpora or genres, comparing them can provide insights into stylistic or thematic differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n"
