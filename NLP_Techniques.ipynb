        "# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers a wide range of techniques and analyses to derive insights from text data. Beyond SVO analysis, here are some commonly used techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🏷 Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
        "Identifies and classifies named entities in the text, such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. This can help in understanding the main subjects or contexts of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 😊 Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "Determines the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. Particularly useful for reviews, feedback, or social media content analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📚 Topic Modeling\n",
        "Identifies topics or themes in a corpus using algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Useful for understanding the main themes in large datasets or categorizing documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📂 Text Classification\n",
        "Categorizes text into predefined classes or labels. Common applications include spam detection, genre classification, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🌀 Text Clustering\n",
        "Groups texts based on similarity without predefined categories. Helps in discovering patterns or themes in datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📄 Text Summarization\n",
        "Produces a concise and coherent summary of a longer text. There are extractive (selecting key sentences) and abstractive (generating new sentences) methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🌐 Dependency Parsing\n",
        "Beyond SVO, it analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence and determines the relationships between tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔗 Coreference Resolution\n",
        "Identifies which words (pronouns and nouns) refer to the same entities in a text. Helps in understanding relationships and contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🧠 Word Embeddings and Semantic Similarity\n",
        "Represents words as vectors in high-dimensional space. Words with similar meanings are closer in this space. Models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText are popular.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## ✒ Text Generation\n",
        "Generates coherent and contextually relevant sentences or paragraphs. Techniques often use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or more recent models like GPT-3.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🌍 Machine Translation\n",
        "Translates text from one language to another. Neural machine translation models have become the state of the art.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## ❓ Question Answering\n",
        "Extracts answers from a given text based on posed questions. Can be rule-based or use deep learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📜 POS Tagging\n",
        "Assigns parts of speech to each word in the text (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🌐 Language Detection and Identification\n",
        "Determines the language of the given text.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🧹 Stopword Removal and Text Cleaning\n",
        "Refines the text data by removing common words (e.g., \"and\", \"the\") and any noise to focus on more meaningful content.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔎 TF-IDF Analysis\n",
        "Weighs terms based on their importance in a document relative to a larger corpus. Helps in keyword extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these techniques provides a unique perspective on the content and structure of text data, and their applicability depends on the specific goals and nature of the analysis.\n"
