        "**Definition:**  \n",
        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that classifies named entities into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## üìå **Why is NER important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Information Retrieval**: Enhance search algorithms by focusing on main entities.\n",
        "2. **Content Recommendation**: Recommend articles or news items that mention specific entities.\n",
        "3. **Data Organization**: Organize content by categorizing based on entities for better content management.\n",
        "4. **Research & Analysis**: Analyze texts to extract key information points swiftly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## üõ† **How Does NER Work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "NER typically involves two main steps:\n",
        "1. **Entity Identification**: Recognize words or sequences of words that correspond to proper nouns.\n",
        "2. **Entity Classification**: Categorize the identified entities into predefined categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## üåê **Common Entity Categories**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Persons**: Names of individuals.\n",
        "- **Organizations**: Names of companies, institutions, etc.\n",
        "- **Locations**: Names of countries, cities, landmarks, etc.\n",
        "- **Dates**: Days, months, years, etc.\n",
        "- **Time**: Hours, minutes, etc.\n",
        "- **Monetary Values**: Money values along with currency types.\n",
        "- **Percentages**: Recognition of percentage values.\n",

        "2. **Research**: Swift extraction of key information points from large texts.\n",
        "3. **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants**: Understand specific entities users refer to.\n",

        "- **Main Subjects**: Understand key focuses of the text.\n",
        "- **Contexts**: Grasp the contexts in which the text operates.\n",
        "- **Temporal Aspects**: Understand time-based contexts if dates and times are frequently mentioned.\n",

        "1. **Ambiguity**: Words with multiple meanings based on context (e.g., \"Apple\" as a fruit or the company).\n",
        "2. **Variability**: Different ways to express the same entity (e.g., \"USA\", \"U.S.A.\", \"United States\").\n",
        "3. **New Entities**: New or lesser-known entities that may not be in the training data.\n",
