        "**Definition:**  \n",
        "SVO stands for Subject-Verb-Object, a prevalent syntactic structure in many languages. Analyzing SVO patterns in a text corpus can reveal the main actors (subjects), their actions (verbs), and entities receiving the action or being acted upon (objects).\n",

        "\n",
        "## üìå **Understanding SVO**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Subject**: The main actor or doer of an action. Typically, a noun or pronoun.\n",
        "2. **Verb**: Represents the action or state being described.\n",
        "3. **Object**: The entity that receives the action or is being acted upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In the sentence \"Cats (Subject) chase (Verb) mice (Object),\" \"Cats\" is the subject, \"chase\" is the verb, and \"mice\" is the object.\n",

        "## üìå **Why Analyze SVO Patterns?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Narrative Structure**: Understanding the primary actors and actions can reveal the main themes or narratives of a text.\n",
        "2. **Content Summarization**: Extracting frequent SVO patterns can help in summarizing content.\n",
        "3. **Relationship Mapping**: Identifying relationships between different entities in the text.\n",
        "4. **Syntax Analysis**: Ensuring sentences are grammatically structured and meaningful.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Data Reduction**: By focusing on primary actors and actions, one can reduce a large text to its essential elements.\n",
        "- **Improved Text Classification**: Knowing common SVO patterns can enhance text classification tasks.\n",
        "- **Enhanced Search**: Allows for more specific and structured search queries in large corpora.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Ambiguous Structures**: Some sentences might have complex structures, making SVO extraction non-trivial.\n",
        "- **Passive Voice**: Sentences in passive voice can invert the typical SVO order.\n",
        "- **Elliptical Constructions**: Some sentences might omit certain parts, leading to incomplete SVO patterns.\n",

        "1. **Information Retrieval**: Retrieving documents based on specific SVO queries.\n",
        "2. **Question Answering Systems**: Extracting answers based on SVO patterns from source texts.\n",
        "3. **Content Creation**: Assisting writers in ensuring varied and diverse sentence structures.\n",
        "4. **Linguistic Studies**: Studying the syntactic structures of languages and comparing SVO patterns across them.\n",
