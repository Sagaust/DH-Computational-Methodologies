        "Text Summarization refers to the process of distilling the most important information from a source (or multiple sources) to produce a shortened version. It helps in providing condensed representations without losing the main content's essence.\n",

        "## üìå **Why is Text Summarization Important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Information Overload**: With the vast amount of information available, there's a need for concise representations.\n",
        "2. **Quick Insights**: Obtain quick insights from lengthy articles, reports, or documents.\n",
        "3. **Enhanced User Experience**: In applications like news aggregators or search engines, where users benefit from concise content.\n",
        "4. **Efficient Content Review**: Helps in tasks like literature review or document analysis where one needs to go through multiple lengthy documents.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are primarily two approaches:\n",
        "1. **Extractive Summarization**: Identifies and extracts the most relevant sentences or phrases from the original text to form the summary.\n",
        "2. **Abstractive Summarization**: Understands the main content and generates new sentences to represent the core ideas, often resulting in a more coherent and concise representation.\n",

        "- **Understanding Context**: The algorithm needs to understand the context to ensure relevant content extraction or generation.\n",
        "- **Relevance Determination**: Decide which sentences or parts are most relevant.\n",
        "- **Redundancy Removal**: Ensure the summary doesn't have repetitive information.\n",
        "- **Coherency Maintenance**: The summary should be coherent and should flow logically.\n",
